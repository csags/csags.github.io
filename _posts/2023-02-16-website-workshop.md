CSAGS is excited to announce a return of the "Lunch & Learn" series. For those that are unfamiliar, "Lunch & Learn" is an opportunity for current graduate students to present on topics of interest, practice presentations, or share exciting ideas with their peers. For this semester's Lunch & Learn series, we plan to **emphasize skill sharing and short workshops.**

The first event was held on February 15th and featured Sam Safran, who led the assembled students and faculty on how to build free academic websites with GitHub pages. As demo, the group created this very site for CSAGS!

For anyone who missed the workshop, you can still find Sam's resources and step-by-step instructions [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tAXi0MI4bHwEcl580hwLMn6Rw8JIhpCHEV0mRPaqadQ/edit?usp=share_link) and embedded below. Please reach out to him if you were unable to attend but would like help with creating your own page.
